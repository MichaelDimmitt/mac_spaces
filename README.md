# mac_spaces
make spaces in terminal are terrible. a bash brew package/brew should handle that. 


<pre>
output of ls command: Aerial_Desktop
tab autocompletion:   Aerial_Desktop\ copy/

... wtf?
</pre>

ever try messing around with mac file's that you did not name.

Better hope they didnt put a space in the name!

Headache's are no fun. Try this package instead. 


Please tell me this exists somewhere so that I do not have to build it. 
<br>It seems so simple and like such an easy thing to do. 
<br>Why wouldnt it already exist?
